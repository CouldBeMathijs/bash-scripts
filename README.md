# memcheck.sh
This script runs the Computer Graphics course engine and checks the memory usage.
To run, copy the script to the project folder which contains your engine, change the Destination folder variable in the script to the working directory you wish to run the engine out of, save, exit and run the script.
# zipper.sh
Stores all c++ header and source files except main.cpp in a zip, for easy uploading to INGInious.
# ziptotar.sh
Replaces all .zip's with equivalent .tar.xz files from the directory the script is ran downwards, .tar.xz is more space efficient, but be careful as some programs store files in zips and you do not want to overwrite those!

More scripts may be added over time
